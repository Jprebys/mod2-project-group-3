    "## PROJECT GOAL\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stakeholders in King County, WA have requested statistical analysis to validate several claims about housing prices in the most recent full calendar year, 2019.**\n",
    " \n",
    " <ins><b>Your task is to build a linear regression model to represent sales prices in King County, and use it to address some of these claims.</b></ins>\n",
    "\n",
    "Six of the claims can be addressed directly with the three datasets (from the King County Department of Assessments) described later in this document:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Higher square footage increases home sale price<sup>1, 2</sup>\n",
    "2. Having a porch increases home sale price<sup>3, 4</sup>\n",
    "3. Having a beachfront or lakefront increases home sale price<sup>5</sup>\n",
    "4. The house filling a higher proportion of the overall lot decreases home sale price<sup>6</sup>\n",
    "5. The cost per square foot is lower in duplexes than in single-family homes<sup>7</sup>\n",
    "6. The presence of a nuisance (power lines, traffic noise, airport noise) decreases home sale price<sup>1, 5</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "Three of the claims would require you to seek out additional datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Access to \"frequent transit\" increases home sale price<sup>6</sup>\n",
    "8. Lower speed limits increase home sale price<sup>6</sup>\n",
    "9. Having an accessory dwelling unit (ADU) increases home sale price<sup>6, 8</sup>\n"

    "## PROJECT REQUIREMENTS\n",
    "\n",
    "**At minimum, your team of data scientists should:**\n",
    "\n",
    " - Build a linear regression model with a target variable of home sale price, which is statistically valid such that any interpretation of coefficients are valid\n",
    "    - Do your best to have features meet the assumptions of a linear regression (no multicollinearity, linear with respect to the outcome variable, errors are normally distributed, etc.). \n",
    "      - Note: This is difficult! We will be looking most of all for _improvement_ on this score. In order to demonstrate improvement, you should create a (not very good) model that will serve as a kind of _baseline_. Then you can compare future regression models that you build with that baseline.\n",
    "    - Try to maximize R<sup>2</sup> _without breaking any assumptions_\n",
    " - Address at least 3 of the 9 claims about housing prices made by subject-matter experts\n",
    "    - Report the effect size as well as the statistical significance\n",
    "    - It is perfectly acceptable to report a non-finding here\n",
    " - Communicate your findings\n",
    "\n",
    "In any extra time:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Engineer additional features to improve R<sup>2</sup> (without violating assumptions), either with the existing datasets or by acquiring additional datasets.\n",
    " - Address additional claims from the subject-matter experts (without violating assumptions).\n",
    " - Utilize additional statistical techniques other than linear regression to address research questions related to the claims investigated.\n",
    " - Make use of bootstrapping to generate confidence intervals for your regression parameters and then compare them with the intervals that statsmodels generates.\n"

    "## THE PROCESS\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps are informed by Smart Vision's<sup>9</sup> description of the CRISP-DM process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Business Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by reading this document, and making sure that you understand the kinds of questions being asked. In order to narrow your focus, you will likely want to make some design choices about your specific audience, rather than addressing all of the \"many people\" mentioned in the background section. Do you want to emphasize affordability, investment, or something else? This framing will help you choose which stakeholder claims to address.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some potential audiences are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Homeowners who want to increase the sale price of their homes through home improvement projects\n",
    "2. Advocacy groups who want to promote affordable housing\n",
    "3. Local elected officials who want to understand how their policy ideas (e.g. zoning changes, permitting) might impact home prices\n",
    "4. Real estate investors looking for potential \"fixer-uppers\" or \"tear-downs\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Three things to be sure you establish during this phase are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Objectives:** what questions are you trying to answer, and for whom?\n",
    "2. **Project plan:** you may want to establish more formal project management practices, such as daily stand-ups or using a Trello board, to plan the time you have remaining. Regardless, you should determine the division of labor, communication expectations, and timeline.\n",
    "3. **Success criteria:** what does a successful project look like? How will you know when you have achieved it?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a script to download the data (or instructions for future users on how to manually download it), and explore it. Do you understand what the columns mean? How do the three data tables relate to each other? How will you select the subset of relevant data? What kind of data cleaning is required?\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that you document the process for retrieving this data so it can be reproduced by a future user.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be useful to generate visualizations of the data during this phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Through SQL and/or Pandas, perform any necessary data cleaning and develop a query that pulls in all relevant data for analysis in a linear regression model, including any merging of tables. Be sure to document any data that you choose to drop or otherwise exclude. This is also the phase to consider any feature scaling or one-hot encoding required to feed the data into a linear regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "The modeling phase in this project should be a brief stop-over as you are jumping back and forth between the data preparation and the evaluation phases.  If the data preparation was done correctly, it only takes a few lines of code to build a linear regression model.  Then you should be able to print out your model's metrics and quickly move to the evaluation phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "(In future modules, there will be more complex steps involved with tuning the model itself.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal here is not to build just one model; it is to build many models and then choose the best one. In this case (which is different from future machine learning models), your goal is to gain additional insight into the housing sales data from 2019 in King County, as opposed to building a generalizable model that can make predictions about unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In other words, you are not trying to build a tool to compete with the Zillow Zestimate to predict home values.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this framing, a higher R<sup>2</sup> is ideal, but you should not focus on attaining a higher R<sup>2</sup> so long as you have gross violations of the assumptions of a linear regression. These assumptions should be your focus both when selecting features and when assessing the quality of your model. Even with a relatively low R<sup>2</sup>, coefficients and p-values will be valid and meaningful if there are no violations of the assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This framing has some implications for your process. For example, you do not want to perform a train-test split or have some other form of hold-out data; you want all of your data to go into getting the best possible coefficients. There is also no single number you can reference to demonstrate that you have the best possible model; in this way causal inference is more of an art, whereas machine learning is more of a science. You can use as many features as you want, but every step of the way you need to check the assumptions, not just check whether R<sup>2</sup> has improved. Because R<sup>2</sup> can only go up when you add more features, you may want to consult the adjusted R<sup>2</sup> metric as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first cycle through these steps should result in some kind of \"baseline\" model.  Once you have that model, create a mini \"report\" that describes the model performance (in terms of R<sup>2</sup> or adjusted R<sup>2</sup>) as well as checks for the assumptions of linear regression.  The Learn labs [Assumptions for Linear Regression](https://learn.co/tracks/module-2-data-science-career-2-1/statistics-ab-testing-and-linear-regression/section-18-introduction-to-linear-regression/assumptions-for-linear-regression), [Ordinary Least Squares in Statsmodels (OLS)](https://learn.co/tracks/module-2-data-science-career-2-1/statistics-ab-testing-and-linear-regression/section-18-introduction-to-linear-regression/ordinary-least-squares-in-statsmodels-ols), and [Regression Diagnostics in Statsmodels](https://learn.co/tracks/module-2-data-science-career-2-1/statistics-ab-testing-and-linear-regression/section-18-introduction-to-linear-regression/regression-diagnostics-in-statsmodels) are a good starting point for this, but you are also free to use external resources, e.g. looking through the statistics available in the [Statsmodels `stats` submodule](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/stats.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "As you build each new model, perform these checks repeatedly to see whether the new models are better than the baseline.  You will almost certainly want to build functions to perform these checks once you get into a rhythm of tweaking the model slightly, evaluating the result, rinse, repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are approaching the end of the available time, choose your best model and report what it says about your research questions. An example finding you might report is: \"There is a statistically significant relationship between `<x variable>` and housing price. For every increase of 1 `<x variable>`, the housing price increases by `<amount>`, all else being equal\". Consider what types of visualizations would help to communicate the scale and direction of these findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond just the numbers, tie these findings into a broader narrative that incorporates your business understanding.  Complete the deliverables listed above, and make sure you can answer the following questions about your process:\n",
    "\n",
    " - \"How did you pick the question(s) that you did?\"\n",
    " - \"Why are these questions important from a business perspective?\"\n",
    " - \"How did you decide on the data cleaning options you performed?\"\n",
    " - \"Why did you choose a given method or library?\"\n",
    " - \"Why did you select those visualizations and what did you learn from each of them?\"\n",
    " - \"Why did you pick those features as predictors?\"\n",
    " - \"How would you interpret the results?\"\n",
    " - \"How confident are you in the predictive quality of the results?\"\n",
    " - \"What are some of the things that could cause the results to be wrong?\"\n"
